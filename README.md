## How to run the jupyter notebooks:

2. Run the jupyter notebook     

## How to run slides, specifically of Chapter 5, Chapter 6, and Chapter 7
We need to install [RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) in order to run the slides.
Specifically, execute the following steps:      
1. Create a conda environment; we name the environment as `rise-env`:     
`$ conda create -n rise-env python=3.8 pandas matplotlib numpy jupyter scipy`

2. Change the environment into our new environment:            
`$ conda activate rise-env`     

3. Install RISE:       
`$ conda install -c conda-forge rise`    

4. Run the jupyter notebooks and enjoy the slides!
